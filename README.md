# The American's Creed

## William Tyler Page

### 1918

I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people; whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed, a democracy in a repbulic, a sovreign Nation of many sovreign States; a perfect union, one and inseparable; established upon thsoe principles of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes.

I therefore believe it is my duty to my country to love it, to support it's Constitution, to obey it's laws, to respect it's flag, and to defend it against all enemies.
